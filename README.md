# contacts-api
Simple API for creating, accessing, modifying, and deleting people contacts

This is written in Python Flask. Unit testing is not included. Also, it works with a local list of contacts in memory, rather than Elasticsearch.
Note that the API itself is mostly functional, though it lacks some error checking, and also lacks the ability to do query searches.

The contact structure includes name, city, and state.
